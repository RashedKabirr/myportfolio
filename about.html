            <div class="title"><h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="me">My name is Ahmad Rashed Kabir. I was born in july 1998 in Afghanistan. I started elementary school in Kabul and after 12 years of 
                school I graduated in 2015. Fast forward to late 2017-2018 I started my first job as an English teacher in a private institute. As an English teacher 
                I was responsible for teaching 'speaking & reading' parts and continued to teach for the next 3 years. But at the same time I was very interested in Software Developement and 
                always fascinated by the new technologies that were coming out everyday so I decided to learn Web Developement in 2021 by myself and the first book I read 
                was 'HTML & CSS for dummies' which really helped understand the basics of programming and did my very first project which was the 'Hello World' program. When I wrote  the  HTML code and the 
                browser interpreted and there was the result on the screen that was the moment I got very excited and I knew that I wanted to be a software developer. And from that time I kept learning 
                and practitng my skills although there was a lot of problems and struggles on my way (the ongoing problems in my country) which caused me to stop the progress And
                take a pause but since I came to Switzerland I started to continue my studies and now as I am writing this text about myself I feel camfortable
                with Html & Css and currently learning JavaScript at <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" class="free">freecodecamp.org</a>. My final goal is to become a successful software developer and create effective applications to help make this world a better place. I am willing to continue to learn other
                programming languages as well. And finally to describe myself in one sentence I would say <br> <span class="spn">"I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious."</span>
